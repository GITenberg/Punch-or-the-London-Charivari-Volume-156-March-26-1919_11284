<h2>CHARIVARIA</h2>
.
<p>WILLIAM HOHENZOLLERN is reported to be busy sawing trees. Some
declare that his energy is due to an hallucination that they are
German generals. Others say the whole story is a clumsy attempt to
discredit him with the Labour party.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Dublin Corporation has decided to increase its revenue by eight
thousand pounds by raising the charge on water. Citizens are urged
to put patriotism before prejudice and give the stuff a trial.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The inconveniences that attend influenza reached their climax a
few days ago when an occupant of a crowded tube train blew the nose
of the man next to him in mistake for his own.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The beggar who has been going about telling a pitiful story of
being wounded by a trench-mortar during the Jutland battle is now
regarded by the police as an impostor.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A defendant in a County Court case at Liverpool last week stated
in his evidence that he had been on the telephone for the last
twenty years. In fairness to the Postal authorities he should have
admitted that it was a trunk call.</p>

THERE'S NO CALL FOR <i>YOU</i> TO KEEP A WATCH ON THE RHINE."</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>A lady-correspondent, writing to a daily paper, laments the fact
that the War has changed a great many husbands. Surely the wife who
receives the wrong husband can get some sort of redress from the
War Office.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>All the main-line railways are to be electrified, Sir ERIC
GEDDES told the House of Commons. Meanwhile he has successfully
electrified all the old buffers.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A number of women are doing good work as mates on Medway sailing
barges. The denial of the report that one of them recently looked
at a Wapping policeman for five minutes on end without once
repeating herself may be ascribed to professional jealousy.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"The small car," says a trade contemporary, "has come to stop."
We can well believe it. It is an old habit.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It has been discovered that the new Education Act, which
prohibits boys under twelve being worked for more than two hours on
Sunday, may apply to choir-boys. A Commission, we understand, is to
be called upon to decide finally whether they are really boys or
just little demons.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A man who applied to the Bloomsbury County Court for relief
against an eviction order stated that he could find no other
suitable house, as he had nine children under fourteen years of
age. His residential problem remains unsolved, but we understand,
with regard to the other difficulty, that the Board of Works has
offered to sell him a card index at considerably below cost.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Bridegrooms," says a contemporary, "are discovering that
weddings cost more." The growing practice among fathers-in-law of
delivering their daughters "free at rail," instead of, as formerly,
"from house to house," may have something to do with it.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Ramsgate," says <i>The Daily Mail</i>, "is racing Margate in
Thanet's reconstruction." At present Margate still claims to lead
by one nigger and two winkle-barrows.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Colorado Legislature has passed a resolution in favour of
Irish independence. The remark attributed to Mr. A.J. BALFOUR, that
he always thought Colorado was the name of a twopenny cigar, has
failed to make the situation easier.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"A pupil at a West London 'out-of-work' school," says a news
item, "daily attends his studies in an opera-hat." On being
informed of this fact, Sir THOMAS BEECHAM is reported to have
expressed the opinion that its significance was obvious.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>President WILSON, it is announced, hopes to visit Scotland
shortly for some golf. He believes that some adjustment of the
dispute as to the respective merits of the running-up and
pitch-and-stop methods of approach should be embodied in the Peace
terms if international harmony is to be really secured.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Primroses and crocuses are blooming in North London. Pending an
official announcement by <i>The Daily Mail</i> people are requested
to accept this as a preliminary Spring.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Concrete ships, says a Government official, can be made in
moulds. But of course you must not forget to grease the tin.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Sinn Feiner, arriving home in Crossgar, Co. Down, last week,
had a very hearty welcome. Thirteen spectators and seven policemen
were injured.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Many members of the Bar are greatly afraid that some learned
judge will ask, "What is the Jazz-step?" before the question has
really been settled by the dancers themselves.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The young lady who, on receiving a proposal of marriage over the
telephone last week, replied, "Yes, who's speaking?" turns out to
be an ex-typist recently demobilised from the Air Ministry.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is interesting to note that to-day is the anniversary of the
day that was not a Flag-day last year.</p>

<h2>THE PRELIMINARY DOVE: ITS PROSPECTS.</h2>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Within a little week or two,</p>
<p class="i2">So all our sanguine prints declare,</p>
<p>The Dove (or Bird of Peace) is due</p>
<p class="i2">To spread its wings and take the air,</p>
<p class="i4">Like Mr. THOMAS when he flew</p>
<p class="i4">Across the firmamental blue</p>
<p class="i4">To join the PREMIER in communion</p>
<p class="i4">Touching the Railway Workers' Union.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>We've waited many a weary week</p>
<p class="i2">With bulging eyes and fevered brow,</p>
<p>While WILSON pressed upon its beak</p>
<p class="i2">His League-of-Nations' olive bough,</p>
<p class="i4">Wondering what amount of weight</p>
<p class="i4">Its efforts could negotiate,</p>
<p class="i4">How much, in fact, the bird would stand</p>
<p class="i4">Without collapsing on the land.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And, even though it should contrive</p>
<p class="i2">To keep its pinions on the flap,</p>
<p>And by a <i>tour de force</i> survive</p>
<p class="i2">This devastating handicap,</p>
<p class="i4">Yet are there perils in the skies</p>
<p class="i4">Whereon we blandly shut our eyes,</p>
<p class="i4">But which are bound to be incurred,</p>
<p class="i4">And, notably, the Bolshy-bird.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>This brand of vulture, most obscene,</p>
<p class="i2">May have designs upon the Dove;</p>
<p>Its carrion taste was never keen</p>
<p class="i2">On the Millennial reign of Love;</p>
<p class="i4">And I, for one, am stiff with fear</p>
<p class="i4">About our little friend's career,</p>
<p class="i4">Lest that disgusting fowl should maul</p>
<p class="i4">And eat it, olive-branch and all.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>I mention this to mark the quaint</p>
<p class="i2">Notion of "Peace" the public has,</p>
<p>That wants to smear the Town with paint,</p>
<p class="i2">To whoop and jubilate and jazz;</p>
<p class="i4">And while our flappers beat the floor</p>
<p class="i4">There's Russia soaked in seas of gore,</p>
<p class="i4">And LENIN waxing beastly fat;</p>
<p class="i4">Nobody seems to think of that.</p>

<h2>PERFECTLY UNAUTHENTIC ANECDOTES.</h2>
<p><i>which may be reproduced (with the permission of Mr. Punch) in
any forthcoming volume of Anybody's Reminiscences</i>.</p>
<p>"You do things so sketchily and casually," said FRITH to
WHISTLER one day. "Now when I paint a picture I take pains. 'The
Derby Day' cost me weeks and months of sleeplessness. I did nothing
else; I gave my whole mind to it." "Oh," said WHISTLER, "that's
where it's gone to, is it?"</p>
<hr />
<p>When Mr. BERNARD SHAW made his tour of the ports in order to
popularise Socialism in the Navy, he was courteously received at
Portsmouth by Sir HEDWORTH MEUX. The talk happened to turn on the
theatre, and the Admiral was candid enough to confess himself
somewhat at sea with regard to the merits of contemporary writers.
"Now, Mr. SHAW," he said in his breezy way, "I wish you would tell
me who is the most eminent of the playwrights of to-day?" "Ay, ay,
Sir," said Mr. SHAW promptly.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dr. Brotherton told me that he was once with MATTHEW ARNOLD in
an election crowd at Oxford, when the Professor of Poetry
accidentally collided with a working-man flown with Radicalism and
beer. "Go to blazes!" said the proletarian. "My friend," replied
ARNOLD, "we are well met. In me you see the official representative
of Literature, whereas you, I perceive, stand for Dogma."</p>
<hr />
<p>Mrs. Brown of Newquay, who claims to be the original <i>Mrs.
Partington</i>, told me that SYDNEY SMITH'S last years were
overclouded by his inability to discover the riddle to which the
answer is contained in the words, "The one rode a horse and the
other rode a dendron."</p>
<hr />
<p>Probably few people remember a Nottinghamshire poet of an
earlier day who fulfilled with much conscientiousness the duties of
local laureate. It was the age of Notts's pre-eminence in cricket,
and that, with other reasons, inspired the bard to write some
verses which opened with the line, "Is there a county to compare
with Notts?" The county of Derby was jealous of its neighbour in
other things besides sport, and considered itself to have scored
when its own tame minstrel retorted with a parody
ending:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Is there a county to compare with Notts?</p>
<p class="i30">Lots!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately the thing was catching, and other counties did
their best to follow suit, though with considerable difficulty as
to rhymes. I think it was a singer of Tavistock who won the
laurels. After disposing of an adjacent rival with the contemptuous
jingle, "Dorset&mdash;Curse it!" he wound up:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Is there a country to compare with Devon?</p>
<p class="i30">Heaven!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr />
<p>Lady Crownderby once told me that she was among the first to see
Lord HOUGHTON on his return from Spain, and she asked him what he
thought of Spanish women in comparison with those of our own
country. "My dear lady," replied HOUGHTON, "I feel like LOT when he
escaped from the Cities of the Plain."</p>
<hr />
<p>At a dinner given in honour of her nephew's appointment to a
Rural Deanery, Mrs. Hinkson-Hanksey told me that she once rallied
DISRAELI on his lack of religious profession, saying how much it
compromised him in the eyes of many of his fellow-countrymen in
comparison with his great rival. "My dear lady," said DISRAELI,
"you are aware that the New Testament divides all men into two
categories. Without specifying the class to which I personally
belong, I am quite willing to admit that Mr. GLADSTONE is a sheep
and possesses many of the characteristics of that admirable
animal."</p>
<hr />
<p>When I was at Hawarden in the summer of 1893, little DOROTHY
DREW asked her grandfather for the loan of a book "to press flowers
in." It is a process, as readers may know, not good for the book,
and I thought the illustrious statesman and bibliophile looked a
little embarrassed. But his face cleared in a moment, and he went
out of the room and presently returned with a sufficient volume, in
which the flowers were duly laid, the book being then, with the
united efforts of the company, subjected to the necessary pressure
under a heavy cabinet. Anxious to know which volume of his beloved
library Mr. GLADSTONE had selected for desecration, I took an early
opportunity of furtively examining the title of the tortured tome.
It was <i>Coningsby</i>.</p>

<h2>GALLERY PLAY.</h2>
<p>It wasn't till Panmore noticed its absence on his return from
France that I remembered the little oil painting which I had left
at the Ferndale Gallery on sale or return, during the early days of
the War, when my financial outlook was bad.</p>
<p>Panmore said he had always wanted to buy it, but hadn't liked to
ask me if I would part with it. I assured him that excess even of
delicacy was a mistake and that I would try to get the picture
back.</p>
<p>So I wrote to the Gallery thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEAR SIRS (it seemed absurd to write "Dear Gallery"),&mdash;In
1914 or 1915 I brought you a small oil painting, which you agreed
to sell or return to me. As I haven't heard from you since, I
conclude that there has been nothing doing in such pictures and I
should like to have it back. The picture is quite a small one,
about the size of an ordinary book, and so far as I recollect it
portrays a man looking at a horse, to see if its withers stand
where they did; or perhaps wondering whether he would sell it and
buy a scooter. As a matter of fact I never took particular notice
of the picture, not caring for it, but a friend of mine who knows
it well appears interested in it and wants to buy it. So please let
me have it back as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>THEOPHILUS B. PIPER-CARY.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;By the way, there's a cow, I remember, in the
background; a red one. Not a red background; a red cow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the answer I received:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;In reply to yours of the 13th inst., we remember
your visit, but cannot trace having such a picture as you describe
in our possession at present. We believe you dealt with our Mr.
James Langford, who joined up in May, 1915, and is not yet
demobilised. He is in Egypt at the moment, we understand, and we
are afraid it would take some time to get into communication with
him.</p>
<p>We shall be glad if under the circumstances you will allow the
matter to rest until his return.</p>
<p>In any case we are afraid we cannot hold ourselves responsible
for the picture, unless you can produce a receipt from us proving
that it reached us.</p>
<p>We are, Yours obediently,</p>
<p><i>pp</i>. THE FERNDALE GALLERY.</p>
<p>J.S.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last paragraph in their letter gave me the impression that
they knew they had the picture but had mislaid it. Meanwhile
Panmore seemed so hot on it and I was so badly hit by the War that
I thought I would have another shot at recovering it. So I
addressed the Gallery as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEAR SIRS,&mdash;Thanks for your letter, and in reply I should
be obliged if you could get another search party out. I have found
a receipt for the picture, signed with a name that might, if
straightened out, be James Langford.</p>
<p>My friend is getting quite excited about it, and he is the sort
of person one wants to humour. He is a Lieut.-Colonel, an O.B.E.,
and, what is more important still, one of the feoffees of Buckley's
Hospital (a fifteenth-century foundation here), and whatever a
feoffee <span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id=
"page237"></a>[pg 237]</span> may be he is not the kind of man to
toy with in a small town like this.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that there is an inn on the left of the
picture, and a girl coming out of it carrying, perhaps, a bran-mash
for the horse or some Government dope for the man, and there are
some hens, all fully regardant and expectant, at her feet.</p>
<p>Hoping to hear in the course of a post or two that you have
found the painting,</p>
<p>I am, Yours anxiously,</p>
<p>THEOPHILUS B. PIPER-CARY.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;Don't forget there's a cow in the background; a red
cow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three days later I received a picture (not mine) from the
Gallery with this letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;After a most exhaustive search we have found and
send herewith what we believe to be your picture, though it does
not quite answer to your description. It is, however, the only one
of which we do not appear to have any record.</p>
<p>Our Mr. Langford seems likely to be abroad for some months, so
unless you will accept this picture in settlement of the matter we
do not see any present way out of the difficulty.</p>
<p>Confident that, if it is not yours, it is at least just as good,
we trust that you will agree to cry quits.</p>
<p>We are, Yours obediently,</p>
<p><i>pp.</i> THE FERNDALE GALLERY.</p>
<p>J.S.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why they should feel sure it was just as good, unless they
remembered my picture, wasn't very clear, but evidently the receipt
had put the wind up them, and I wrote and accepted the substitute
at once, because Panmore liked it better even than the original
picture. He said it was an Alken and gave me far more than I would
have thought of asking for it, or for the original one.</p>
<p>About a week after selling it I received this wire from the
Gallery:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please return painting sent in error. Very valuable Alken. Have
customer.</p>
<p>FERNDALE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Diamond cut diamond," I said to myself. And I replied
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEAR SIRS,&mdash;I received your wire, but regret that I cannot
comply with your request. Firstly, because I have already accepted
the picture which you regarded as mine or its equivalent, in place
of the one that was mine and is now yours; and, secondly, because
my friend the feoffee has already bought it, the one that was yours
and is now mine, or rather his (you know what I mean, don't you?),
and I haven't the heart to ask him to return it.</p>
<p>Perhaps yours (the one that is now yours and was mine before),
being the equivalent of the one that was yours and is now mine (or
rather the feoffee's), would suit your client. I can only suggest
your having another look for it; the matter so far as I am
concerned is at an end. Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>THEOPHILUS B. PIPER-CARY.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;You'll know it when you find it. There's a red cow in
the background.</p>

<h4>The Rising Egg.</h4>
<p>Whatever may be the decline in the price of eggs their social
movement is clearly upwards. The following passage from <i>The
Croydon Advertiser</i> gives an admirable life-history of the egg,
from shell to profit-sharing:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Eggs will be dated and graded and sold accordingly, and as soon
as they have done laying fattened for table purposes, also young
cockerels. They will be killed and plucked, and the feathers will
be sorted and sold in the best markets. So you see they will

"INFLUENZA MICROBE DISCOVERED AT A LONDON HOSPITAL."</div>
<hr />
<h2>MRS. BLOGGINS'S STATEMENT.</h2>
<p>It is not too much to say that bed-making circles in Cambridge
have been agitated to their utmost depths by the recent advent of
some hundreds of American youths who have come to pursue certain
courses of study within the University walls. Let us make one thing
perfectly clear. Bed-makers do not object to Americans as
Americans, but this avalanche of Transatlantics arrives on the very
eve of the vacation, just when the bed-makers are packing off the
contingent of young Naval officers who have been making things hum
during the past term.</p>
<p>Persuaded that their too-brief holidays will be entirely
absorbed in attending to the Americans, the bed-makers urge with
some justice that they too are entitled to enjoy the beautiful
things of this enchanting world quite as much as miners and
railway-men. We understand that meetings of their Association are
being held, and that the University authorities are faced by a
situation which is rapidly passing beyond their control. Bed-makers
are amongst the most loyal members of the community, but they feel,
as a prominent member of the profession put it, that "the last
camel breaks the straw's back," and they are determined to uphold
their immemorial rights.</p>
<p>We have thought it our duty therefore to interview the
celebrated Mrs. Bloggins, the <i>doyenne</i> of the Corps of
Bed-makers of Trinity College. We found the lady in her home in
Paradise Walk, where she was engaged in eating some excellent
buttered toast. We lost no time in explaining the purport of our
visit.</p>
<p>"We desire to know, Mrs. Bloggins," we began, "what your
feelings are with regard to the Americans."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Mrs. Bloggins, speaking with deep emotion, "you may
well call 'em Americans, for I've never bin so troubled about
anythink before. Some people seem to git the notion into their
'eads that bed-makers do no work. Why we're arst to slave from
mornin' till night, and our pay is paltry. Things in Cambridge
isn't like what they was. Time was when our young gentlemen used to
'ave big dinners in their rooms, and a careful bed-maker could save
a bone or two. Nowadays they,'re only cheese-parers, that's what I
call 'em. You won't believe me, I know, but my mother, who was a
bed-maker afore me, used to 'ave a month at the seaside every year,
all paid for out of money give to 'er by 'er young gentlemen. To be
sure there was a wrangler, or somethink of that kind, who didn't
come up to the mark, so she soon got rid of 'im; 'e used to find
'is butter was took by the cat, and accidents of that kind.</p>
<p>"Mind yer," she continued, "I ain't got nothink to say against
the Americans. They may be the most liberal-'earted gentlemen in
the world for all I know. But it's the principle of the thing I'm
objectin' to. It's a case of kill me quick or cure me to-morrow,
and if President WILSON was to talk till next week 'e couldn't make
it no different. You can't make a silk sock out of a side of bacon,
and that's true whichever way you look at it."</p>
<p>"But what steps," we urged, "does your Association intend to
take, Mrs. Bloggins, over this matter?"</p>
<p>"I don't know nothink about no 'sociations," said Mrs. Bloggins,
"but I do know that we're all in it, and Mrs. Pledger and Mrs.
'Uggins, and the rest of 'em, we knows our power and we intends to
use it."</p>
<p>"In what way do you mean?" I said.</p>
<p>She looked at me cunningly.</p>
<p>"Now you're spyin'. It's dirty work and I won't 'ave it 'ere.
You might be the Proctor hisself for all I cares&mdash;you're not
going to ferret nothink out of me."</p>
<p>Hereupon she rose with great dignity and plainly indicated that
the interview was at an end.</p>

<h2>TO THE DEATH.</h2>
<blockquote class="note">
<p>[According to the papers, two Frenchmen have agreed to fight a
duel in aeroplanes.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Cauliflower!" shrieked Gaspard Volauvent across the little
table in the <i>estaminet</i>. His face bristled with rage.</p>
<p>"Serpent!" replied Jacques Rissolo, bristling with equal
dexterity.</p>
<p>The two stout little men glared ferociously at each other. Then
Jacques picked up his glass and poured the wine of the country over
his friend's head.</p>
<p>"Drown, serpent!" he said magnificently. He beckoned to the
waiter. "Another bottle," he said. "My friend has drunk all
this."</p>
<p>Gaspard removed the wine from his whiskers with the local paper
and leant over the table towards Jacques.</p>
<p>"This must be wiped out in blood," he said slowly. "You
understand?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly," replied the other. "The only question is
whose."</p>
<p>"Name your weapons," said Gaspard Volauvent grandly.</p>
<p>"Aeroplanes," replied Jacques Rissole after a moment's
thought.</p>
<p>"Bah! I cannot fly."</p>
<p>"Then I win," said Jacques simply.</p>
<p>The other looked at him in astonishment.</p>
<p>"What! You fly?"</p>
<p>"No; but I can learn."</p>
<p>"Then I will learn too," said Gaspard with dignity. "We
meet&mdash;in six months?"</p>
<p>"Good." Jacques pointed to the ceiling. "Say three thousand feet
up."</p>
<p>"Three thousand four hundred," said Gaspard for the sake of
disagreeing.</p>
<p>"After all, that is for our seconds to arrange. My friend
&Eacute;pinard of the Roullens Aerodrome will act for me. He will
also instruct me how to bring serpents to the ground."</p>
<p>"With the idea of cleansing the sky of cauliflowers," said
Gaspard, "I shall proceed to the flying-ground at Dormancourt;
Blanchaille, the instructor there, will receive your friend."</p>
<p>He bowed and walked out.</p>
<p>Details were soon settled. On a date six months ahead the two
combatants would meet three thousand two hundred feet above the
little town in which they lived, and fight to the death. In the
event of both crashing, the one who crashed last would be deemed
the victor. It was Gaspard's second who insisted on this clause;
Gaspard himself felt that it did not matter.</p>
<p>The first month of instruction went by. At the end of it Jacques
Rissole had only one hope. It was that when he crashed he should
crash on some of Gaspard's family. Gaspard had no hope, but one
consolation. It was that no crash could involve his stomach, which
he invariably left behind him as soon as the aeroplane rose.</p>
<p>At the end of the second month Gaspard wrote to Jacques.</p>
<p>"My friend," he wrote, "the hatred of you which I nurse in my
bosom, and which fills me with the desire to purge you from the
sky, is in danger of being transferred to my instructor. Let us
therefore meet and renew our enmity."</p>
<p>Jacques Rissole wrote back to Gaspard.</p>
<p>"My enemy," he wrote, "there is nobody in the whole of the
Roullens aerodrome whom I do not detest with a detestation beside
which my hatred for you seems as maudlin adoration. This is
notwithstanding the fact that I make the most marvellous progress
in the art of flying. It is merely something in their faces which
annoys me. Let me therefore see yours again, in the hope that it
will make me think more kindly of theirs."</p>
<p>They met, poured wine over each other and parted. After another
month the need of a further stimulant was felt. They met again, and
agreed to insult each other weekly.</p>
<p>On the last day of his training Gaspard spoke seriously to his
instructor.</p>
<p>"You see that I make nothing of it," he said. "My thoughts are
ever with the stomach that I leave behind. Not once have I been in
a position to take control. How then can I fight? My friend, I
arrange it all. You shall take my place."</p>
<p>"Is that quite fair to Rissole?" asked Blanchaille
doubtfully.</p>
<p>"Do not think that I want you to hurt him. That is not
necessary. He will hurt himself. Keep out of his way until he has
finished with himself, and then fly back here. It is easy."</p>
<p>It seemed the best way; indeed the only way. Gaspard Volauvent
could never get to the <i>rendezvous</i> alone, and it would be
fatal to his honour if Jacques arrived there and found nobody to
meet him. Reluctantly Blanchaille agreed.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour Gaspard put his head cautiously out of his
bedroom window and gazed up into the heavens. He saw two aeroplanes
straight above him. At the thought that he might have been in one
of them he shuddered violently. Indeed he felt so unwell that the
need for some slight restorative became pressing. He tripped off to
the <i>estaminet</i>.</p>
<p>It was empty save for one table. Gaspard walked towards it,
hoping for a little conversation. The occupant lowered the
newspaper from in front of his face and looked up.</p>
<p>It was too much for Gaspard.</p>
<p>"Coward!" he shrieked.</p>
<p>Jacques, who had been just going to say the same thing, hastily
substituted "Serpent!"</p>
<p>"I know you," cried Gaspard. "You send your instructor up in
your place. Poltroon!"</p>
<p>Jacques picked up his glass and poured the wine of the country
over his friend's head.</p>
<p>"Drown, serpent," he said magnificently. He beckoned to the
waiter. "Another bottle," he said. "My friend has drunk all
this."</p>
<p>Gaspard removed the wine from his whiskers with Jacques' paper
and leant over him.</p>
<p>"This must be wiped out in blood," he said slowly. "Name your
weapons."</p>
<p>"Submarines," said Jacques after a moment's thought.</p>

<h2>THE SCHLOSS BILLET.</h2>
<p>We had not expected much of a billet in a defeated and starving
country; that was probably why everybody was enthusiastic over
it&mdash;at first. I, as billeting officer, was especially proud of
having discovered it. The very thing for Brigade
Headquarters&mdash;secluded, dignified, commanding and
spacious.</p>
<p>A couple of kilos from the gates through the drive brings you to
the Schloss. Entering a hall about the size of a modern theatre you
journey to the ante-room, a vast apartment, which for space
compares favourably with the Coliseum at Rome. A world-exhibition
of pictures and tapestries covers the walls of the Schloss, while
an acre or two of painted ceiling shows the chief events of German
history, from the Creation to the Franco-Prussian War.</p>
<p>In the Dining-room, reached by a progress over carpets and rugs
representative of all the best periods of Oriental art, it would be
fairly easy to stage a review on the table itself; while in the
Music-room a hundred or so lorries could be parked without
attracting observation too glaringly. Should the need arise, the
Library could accommodate a battalion on parade, a rifle range or
sufficient office room for Q branch of a division. A labyrinth of
corridors and servants' bedrooms harbours the rank and file, and it
is said that the number of kitchens, pantries and cellars in the
north and east wings runs into three figures.</p>
<p>The Divisional Commander called it "homely"; the Corps Commander
remarked that its style was "not cramped, anyhow&mdash;what?" and
the Army Commander pronounced it very "cosy."</p>
<p>The first two days I did not see my servant at all. On Wednesday
he turned up just before lunch. On Monday and Tuesday, he
explained, he had wandered through corridors and passages trying to
find my room, and, by rising an hour before <i>reveille</i>, he
thought he would be able to get from his quarters to mine by about
breakfast-time.</p>
<p>We used to adjourn to the billiard-room after dinner, but gave
it up because it was necessary to stop play at half-past ten in
order to be in bed by midnight. Signals is worried because he has
not enough line left to reach Battalions, all available supplies
having been used up in connecting the General's room with various
parts of the Schloss. We are continually late for dinner owing to
errors in judging the distances from one room to another. Our once
happy family has dissolved into silent morose individuals, for we
have grown strange and distant to one another. Liaison between
departments has broken down, and the Staff-Captain whom I saw
yesterday in the distance is suffering from premature decay.</p>
<p>But a solution has been found, for the Engineers are unloading a
couple of Nissen huts to put up in the hall, and we shall soon be a
united family once more.</p>

<p><i>Monday, March 17th</i>.&mdash;Mr. GEORGE TERRELL, always a
little inclined to look upon the black side of things, was
apprehensive about the spread of Bolshevism in this country. Not so
Lord HENRY BENTINCK, who genially exploded with "Is not Bolshevism
in this country a pure bogey?" Not quite that, perhaps; but I
gathered that in Mr. BONAR LAW'S opinion it hasn't a ghost of a
chance.</p>
<p>Great cheers from the Wee Frees greeted the advent of Mr. A.E.
NEWBOULD, the victor of West Leyton, whose defeat of the Coalition
candidate has increased the size of their party by something like
four per cent. As the new Member is understood to be connected with
the film business his colleagues are hoping that they will soon
have Ministers on the "movies."</p>
<p>We know on high authority that evil communications corrupt good
manners. Sir ERIC GEDDES goes further and believes that they
corrupt everything. That was the text of his capital speech on the
second reading of the Transportation Bill. Dispensing on this
occasion with his usual typescript, he discoursed at large for an
hour and a-half on the paralytic condition of our railways, roads,
canals and docks.</p>
<p>We all had our pleasant morning dreams, he said, but they
usually disappeared after we had had our cold bath; and the
country, which was no longer rich, but poor, must take its douche.
His own dream is of a beautifully centralised control, directing
all our traffic agencies (save tramways and shipping) into the most
convenient channels; and he won't be happy till he gets it. But
judging by some of the speeches that followed he too may have a
frigid disillusionment when the Bill comes up against the
"interests" in Committee. Mr. T.P. O'CONNOR, on behalf of
Liverpool, described it as the product of "an old bureaucracy and a
young Parliamentarian," and Mr. RENWICK declared that, if it
passed, the Manchester Ship Canal would be "between the devil and
the deep sea," surely an uncalled-for attack on Cottonopolis.</p>
<p>Upon the adjournment, Col. CLAUDE LOWTHER again raised the
question of the payment of German indemnities, and Mr. BONAR LAW
again declared that the policy of the Government was to demand the
largest amount that Germany could pay, but not to demand what we
knew she couldn't pay. It would have saved him a lot of trouble if
at the General Election the Government spokesmen had insisted as
much upon the second half of the policy as they did upon the
first.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, March 18th</i>.&mdash;GILBERT'S fanciful description
of the "most susceptible Chancellor" is justified by the way in
which the present occupant of the Woolsack and his predecessors vie
with one another in the endeavour to secure the favour of the fair
sex. Today it was Lord HALDANE'S turn to oblige, and he brought in
a Bill to enable Scotswomen to become Advocates and Law Agents.
Lord HALSBURY'S contribution to the work of feminine emancipation
has not yet been announced. The rumour that a deputation of ladies
recently approached him with a proposal that they should be
eligible for judicial office&mdash;"Scarlet and ermine are
<i>so</i> becoming"&mdash;and that he put them off with the old
joke about there being "enough old women on the Bench already" is,
of course, apocryphal.</p>
<p>Not infrequently in the official reports of the Lords' debates a
speech begins thus: "Lord &mdash;&mdash; (<i>who was indistinctly
heard</i>)." The Commons' report might well adopt this salutary
practice as a warning to Members who persistently mumble, or who
address their remarks to the body of the House instead of to the
SPEAKER. Ministers are the worst offenders. One of them was asked
this afternoon, for example, whether the Judicial Adviser to the
SULTAN had discouraged the use of the English language in the
Egyptian Courts, but all we could hear of the <i>sotto voce</i>
conversation between him and his interrogator was that
"er&mdash;er&mdash;language&mdash;er&mdash;had&mdash;been&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;misunderstood."</p>
<p>Some savages, travellers tell us, are unable to count beyond
five. Some Ministers, on the other hand, show an inability to
reckon except in millions. Mr. CHURCHILL, when asked how many
soldiers were not receiving the recent increase of pay, remarked
casually that the numbers were "not so very
great&mdash;half-a-million would cover them." Happily these "sloppy
statistics" (to recall a phrase used by Mr. ASQUITH <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg 246]</span> during
the Tariff Reform controversy) do not appeal to the
FOOD-CONTROLLER. He, being invited to say whether the Government
had made "approximately &pound;2,400,000" by the charge on
cattle-sales, replied that the amount was "approximately"
&pound;3,449,939; and we felt that he was cut to the heart at not
being able to give the odd shillings and pence.</p>
<p>The renewed debate on the Transportation Bill revealed a good
deal of opposition. Roadmen thought it an excellent project for
railways; railwayman were all in favour of its being applied to
docks; and dockmen had no objection to its being tried on the
roads. But none of them wanted it for his own particular interest.
Sir EDWARD CARSON'S objections were both particular and general.
Belfast would be ruined if its port were controlled by "a nest of
politicians" in Dublin, but apart from that he doubted whether the
promised economies would be realised in any direction. Ministers
were "gluttons for centralisation," and would, he prophesied, incur
the usual fate of gluttons, acute indigestion.</p>
<p>Mr. BONAR LAW, while admitting that he himself would not have
voted for the Bill five years ago, declared that the War had made
it essential. That seemed to be the general opinion, for the second
reading was agreed to without a division.</p>

Trying It On.</div>
<p><i>Wednesday, March 19th</i>.&mdash;Lord MALMESBURY, who has
lately been the victim of a burglary, attributed it to
housebreakers having been demobilised before policemen. Whether
this was done on the ground that they conducted "one man
businesses," or because someone in Whitehall assumed that the
wielders of the centre-bit must be "pivotal," I do not know, but an
Army Order requiring Commanding Officers to keep the balance even
between criminals and coppers seems to be urgently needed.</p>
<p>The Bishops were delighted to hear from Lord ERNLE that his
department includes a Hop-Controller, and are going to ask him to
turn his attention to the Jazz.</p>
<p>Museums could not be opened just yet, said Lord STANMORE,
because some eight thousand officials of various departments were
at present lodged in these buildings. To judge by the comments of
the public Press, there are several hundreds more who ought to be
kept there.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, March 20th</i>.&mdash;Lord WINTERTON wanted to know
what the Government was doing to counteract Mr. BERNARD SHAW'S
alleged anti-British propaganda in the United States. Mr. CECIL
HARMSWORTH thought Professor OMAN'S recent memorandum would prove a
sufficient counterblast. He had, however, no objection to adding
Mr. SHAW'S latest pamphlet to "the large budget of Shavian
literature" already at the Foreign Office, where, it is said, the
clerks on night-duty like to beguile their leisure with light
fiction.</p>
<p>Late in the evening Mr. BONAR LAW announced the intentions of
the Government with regard to the coal industry. It would adopt Mr.
Justice SANKEY'S report, giving the men a large portion of their
demands. If the miners still persisted in striking&mdash;well, the
State would strike too, with all its might; otherwise there was an
end of government in this country. The cheers which greeted this
statement seriously annoyed Mr. JACK JONES, who sits for
Silvertown, and maintains the explosive reputation of his
constituency.</p>

<h2>DRAMATISTS TO THE RESCUE.</h2>
<p>In view of the theory developed by the Ministry of
Reconstruction's Sub-Committee on Organisation and Conditions of
Domestic Service, that "the attitude adopted by the Press and the
Stage is usually an unfortunate one, as servants are frequently
represented as comic or flippant characters, and are held up to
ridicule," a meeting of our leading dramatists was hastily convened
last evening by Lady HEADFORT (who, it will be remembered, is all
for calling her maids "Home-birds") to engage their sympathetic
co-operation in aid of mistresses, housekeepers and employers
generally. What the stage has taken away the stage must give back:
that is Lady HEADFORT'S contention. Not that the domestic problem
will even then be settled; there will probably still be difficulty
in persuading W.A.A.C.s and Land Women and Munitioners who have
tasted blood to descend below stairs again; but perhaps a little
help will be forthcoming. Hence this influential gathering.</p>
<p>Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT, who presided, said that the domestic
problem was one of great seriousness. Personally he rarely
descended to the servants' hall, but he did not pretend to be
unaware of the usefulness of such regions and of our dependence
upon them. There must be give and take. If the stage had been
guilty of too much levity in its portraiture of domestic servants,
then, in the interests of all of us, it must make what our lively
neighbours call the <i>amende honorable</i>.</p>
<p>Sir JAMES BARRIE said that no one could hold him personally to
blame. His plays had always exhibited domestic servants in a most
favourable light. Not only was a butler the hero of <i>The
Admirable Crichton</i>, a maidservant the heroine of <i>A Kiss for
Cinderella</i> and a charwoman the heroine of <i>The Old Lady Shows
Her Medals</i>, but the actual authorship of <i>Peter Pan</i> was
given to the smallest nursemaid on record.</p>
<p>Mr. SOMERSET MAUGHAM also claimed to be on the side of the
home-birds. Had he not in <i>Smith</i> written a part of strong
parlour-maid interest for Miss MARIE L&Ouml;HR?</p>
<p>Mr. G.B. SHAW said that there was no need for the meeting at
all, because he was just putting the finishing touches to a witty
drama which would settle the whole question. In this play, which,
he could tell them on the best authority in the world, his own, was
a work of surpassing genius, the Irish Question, which had baffled
statesmen and philosophers for centuries, is settled once and for
all by the wisdom and presence of mind of a Kerry kitchenmaid.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg
247]</span><p>The Chairman said that perhaps the meeting might as
well proceed with its discussion, since there was always the
possibility that the run of Mr. SHAW'S play might not equal that of
his last, which, he understood, had just been produced in New York
and had come off almost at once.</p>
<p>Mr. HENRY ARTHUR JONES said that if any branch of art could
effect social transformations it was the drama. Personally he
looked upon the stage as only one degree less powerful than the
Senate and vastly more serious than the Church. Its first duty was
to instruct, elevate and reform; to amuse was never its true
function. Hence, if the dramatists of the country cared to take up
the task of remedying the servant shortage, the matter would be
quickly settled. But only, added the speaker with extreme gravity,
if the authors of the pernicious rubbish known as <i>revue</i> were
first gagged and bound.</p>
<p>Mr. MAX PEMBERTON said that, although he had given up
<i>revue</i> writing in favour of transforming farcical plays, he
felt that he might make an appeal to the authors of <i>revue</i>
(who often exceeded the audience in number) to join in this very
laudable campaign. Speaking as one of the two-and-twenty
Hippodromios, although no longer in that capacity, he would appeal
to his successors to paint life below stairs in such resplendent
hues that the desire instantly to take service would be implanted
in every female bosom.</p>
<p>Mr. ALFRED SUTRO, speaking at the moment not so much as a
dramatist as a man without a cook, said that he agreed heartily
with the sentiments of the gentleman who had just sat down.</p>
<p>Sir ARTHUR WING PINERO said that he was always willing to help
worthy causes and was as ready to write a play for the object in
view as, not long since, he had been to write one to encourage
economy. But it was useless unless the company chosen would
co-operate. The dramatist did not stand alone. So long as the
ordinary stage idea of a parlourmaid was a saucy nymph with a
feather brush and very short skirts, so long would dramatists
strive in vain to exalt her calling. He was prepared to do his
best, but feared that the actors' traditions would prove too
strong.</p>
<p>Mr. WALTER MELVILLE said that he hoped nothing would be done to
tamper with such traditions as Sir ARTHUR complained of. It was the
duty of a stage servant to begin plays and to be funny. The curtain
of a farce should rise on a butler and a parlourmaid remarking on
the fact that master was suspiciously late last night; and the
butler should be amorous, bibulous and peculative, and the
parlourmaid coy and trim. Similarly, footmen should be haughty and
drop their aitches, cooks short-tempered, red and fat, and
office-boys knowing and cheeky. The public expected it, and the
public ought to have it because the public paid.</p>
<p>There being no further remarks, the meeting dispersed, the
various speakers returning sadly home to perform the household
duties.</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE-HUNTER</h2>
<p>Unless something is done for Higgins without delay the nation
must prepare to face a tremendous rise in the rate of mortality
among house-agents.</p>
<p>Soon after he came back from the War he began to adopt a
threatening attitude (as the police-court witnesses say) towards
these gentlemen. Recently he has gone beyond the threatening stage.
If rumour can be trusted, he has thrown at least six of them
through their office windows. He has taken a dislike to the whole
tribe. They are, in his opinion, a gang of criminals for whom no
punishment could be too severe, because they impose upon the public
in general and Higgins in particular, by continuing in business as
if they were in a position to let houses when, as a matter of fact,
there are no houses for them to let.</p>
<p>Higgins wants a house. Yes, incredible though it may sound, this
man, who for years has been content to dwell in a dug-out or
consort with creeping things in the confines of a canvas tent, and
even on occasion make his bed beneath the starry dome of heaven,
with nothing in between, has now developed a craving for a
residence built of bricks and mortar.</p>
<p>What is more, he expects the house-agents to find it for him,
and, since he considers the whole thing from the purely personal
point of view, their excuses for failing to do so are of no avail.
The fact that half a million other people want houses is nothing to
him. He ignores it. He believes that the house-agentry of the
country has hatched a gigantic conspiracy to keep him, Higgins, out
of a home.</p>
<p>I have done <i>my</i> best to put him out of his misery. After
seeing the poor wretch wear himself (and his boots) out in useless
journeying to and from the places where house-agents pretend to
work I thought of a scheme&mdash;not strictly original&mdash;for
obtaining a house and presented it to him without hope of
reward.</p>
<p>"You are committing and error," I said.</p>
<p>"I shall commit a murder in a minute," he growled but, knowing
what he had suffered, I took no notice of the threat.</p>
<p>"Listen," I said; "all the habitable houses in England are
occupied and it will be years before the new ones are built. The
painting of "TO LET" boards has become a lost art. You are wasting
your time in looking for an <i>empty</i> dwelling. Take my advice.
Choose one that is occupied, any one you fancy, and empty it."</p>
<p>At this point he interpolated an offensive expression with which
I was not familiar before I joined the army, but I overlooked that
also.</p>
<p>"You think it is impossible, but you are wrong," I told him.
"This scheme is bound to succeed. All you have to do is to haunt
the house. You do not eject the tenant yourself. You conjure up a
ghost to do it for you."</p>
<p>"The devil!"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;not necessarily. An ordinary ghost will do."</p>
<p>"But, my dear good fool, how in Hades or out of it can I produce
a ghost?"</p>
<p>"Easily. By <i>suggestion</i>. That is the secret. This is an
age of suggestion. Doctors are curing patients by suggestion.
Politicians hypnotise the public by suggestion. And you can
frighten the present occupants out of your chosen home by
suggestion. No real ghost is required. Having selected the house
you pay a call and lay ground-bait, so to speak. You tell the
tenant you are interested in the place because you happen to know
that at one time it was haunted. You relate a gruesome tale of some
mysterious tragedy that you say has occurred there, and generally
make your victim's flesh creep.</p>
<p>"He or she, a woman for choice, will probably laugh at first.
Never mind. Allow a few days for the idea to sink in, and then call
again. It is a hundred to one that you will hear that strange
manifestations have been observed. After that it will be plain
sailing. You will continue to call, always supplying fresh
suggestion, until at last, thoroughly unnerved, the tenant will
bolt, probably taking refuge in a hotel. That will be your chance.
Snatch the place up at once, and there you are."</p>
<p>For the first time since he was demobilised, Higgins smiled.</p>
<p>"By Heavens!" he said, "I'll try it. There's a little place at
Croydon which would be a perfect billet. I will pay my first visit
at once."</p>
<p>He sauntered away, proclaiming in song the satisfactory
condition of rose-culture in Picardy.</p>
<p>Yesterday he came back.</p>
<p>His face was grim. There was a light in his eye which I did not
like. He made no mention of roses blooming in Picardy or anywhere
else.</p>
<p>"How is the scheme working?" I asked. "Have you called on the
Croydon gentleman?"</p>
<p>"I have," he answered; "and when I had laid the blessed
ground-bait, as you call it, he told me he always did think there
was a ghost about the place, and he was delighted to have his
theory confirmed. He wants more details now. He invites me to
furnish evidence. What for, you ask? Well, you see, he happens to
be an active member of the Society for Psychical Research."</p>

<h2>SILLY SEASONING.</h2>
<p>The strange case of the halibut and the cormorant, recently
reported in the daily Press, has brought us a budget of interesting
letters, from which we select the following as agreeable evidence
of the return of normal conditions in the fish-story-telling
industry:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Gullane, N.B.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;One of the most striking results of the War has
been its effect on the mentality of birds and animals and even
fishes. The papers have lately contained accounts of a halibut
which swallowed a cormorant and survived the exploit only to fall a
victim to the wiles of a North Sea fisherman. As the cormorant is
generally regarded to be the <i>dernier cri</i> in voracity, the
incident illustrates the old saying of the biter bit. As a rule
birds of prey have the upper hand in their contests with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg
249]</span> finny denizens of the deep. But the triumph of the
halibut is not altogether unprecedented. I remember, when I was
cruising in the China Seas in the year 1854, witnessing a combat
between a dolphin and a Bombay duck, in which the latter came off
second-best. And some thirty years later, during a yachting
excursion off the Scilly Isles, I saw an even more remarkable duel
between a porbeagle&mdash;as the Cornish people call the
mackerel-shark&mdash;and a pipit, in which, strange to relate, the
bird came off victorious.</p>
<p>Believe me to be, Sir,</p>
<p>Yours truthfully,</p>
<p>CONSTANTINE PHIBSON.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Tara, Diddlebury</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;When I was an undergraduate at Cambridge in the
'sixties a "Limerick" was current which began as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"There was an adventurous sole</p>
<p>Which swallowed an albatross whole."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately I cannot remember the conclusion of the stanza,
nor am I able to state whether it was founded on fact or was merely
an ebullition of lyrical fancy. In the latter case the lines are a
striking instance of the prophetic power of minstrelsy, and justify
the use of the word "<i>vates</i>," or seer, as applied to poets by
the ancient Romans.</p>
<p>I have the honour to be, Sir,</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>SEPTIMUS BOWLONG.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Rougemont Villa, Crookhaven.</i></p>
<p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;The halibut-cormorant episode has attracted
undue attention, since many similar but far more extraordinary
incidents have occurred during the War, but have passed unrecorded
owing to the claims of Bellona. I will confine myself to one which
was witnessed by my daughter Anna in course of bathing at
Sheringham in August, 1917. While swimming underwater she collided
with a middle-sized sea-serpent, which was evidently in
difficulties and made its way to the beach, where it expired. The
post-mortem, which was conducted by Professor Darcy Johnson,
F.R.S., revealed that the serpent had been choked by a gigantic
gooseberry, which had formed part of the cargo of a Greenland tramp
torpedoed by an enemy submarine. The serpent was actually being
stuffed when a bomb dropped by a Zeppelin blew it into
infinitesimal smithereens, to the profound disappointment of the
Professor and my daughter Anna, who has never been quite the same
woman since. Permit me to subscribe myself</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>ALEXANDER NIAS.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Steep Hill, Cramlington.</i></p>
<p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;There is nothing surprising in the story of a
halibut devouring a cormorant. As you will see from consulting
<i>Murray</i>, halibut means "holy-butt" (or flat-fish), and holy
fishes are possessed of magical powers. When I lived on the coast
of Florida I had a tame tarpon, which could swallow
anything&mdash;croquet balls, door scrapers&mdash;and once ate an
entire cottage pianoforte in half-an-hour. Here I may add that in
my travels in Turkestan I was attacked by a boa-constrictor, and,
though I escaped with my life, it proceeded to swallow the Bactrian
camel on which I was riding. On the following day, however, when
the boa was still in a comatose condition, I killed it with a
boomerang, rescued the camel and continued my journey without
further mishap.</p>
<p>I am, Sir, Yours veraciously,</p>
<p>ANDREW MERRIMAN.</p>

<h2>THE DISCIPLINARIAN.</h2>
<p>Saluting is rapidly becoming a thing of the past, even among
British-born soldiers. Dating from the Armistice, it has lapsed
more and more, until now it is practically extinct.</p>
<p>Now I regard this as serious. I have ever been a stickler for
discipline, and consequently I dislike it when men pass
by&mdash;not, like the Levite, on the other side&mdash;but close to
me without so much as a click of the eyeballs.</p>
<p>So I decided that I as a disciplinarian would make a stand
against it; I would keep my eyes open for any particularly flagrant
case. When I found it I intended to let myself go. I promised
myself an agreeable ten minutes&mdash;or longer, if I got properly
worked up.</p>
<p>My chance came the other day. I was strolling down Regent Street
when three N.C.O.'s, including a sergeant, passed me. They did not
salute. I might have been a civilian for all the notice they took
of me. Ha! my hour had come.</p>
<p>Turning, I hastened after them.</p>
<p>"Sergeant, a word."</p>
<p>They stopped and the Sergeant asked if I was speaking to
him.</p>
<p>"Have you ever heard of the little word 'Sir,' Sergeant?" I
asked severely.</p>
<p>"Evidently not. However I pass over that. But a moment ago you
went by me without saluting. Deliberately&mdash;inexcusably. I was
as close to you as I am now."</p>
<p>"But how&mdash;" began the Sergeant.</p>
<p>"Not a word," I cut him short. "Not a word. You know perfectly
well that you have neglected your duty grossly. Now tell me. Is it
your own idea to drop saluting, or has Mr. CHURCHILL had a word in
your ear?" (Sarcasm is my strong point.)</p>
<p>"But look here&mdash;" said the Sergeant, rather red in the
face.</p>
<p>"Do not interrupt," I thundered, warming to my work. "How, I
ask, do you expect the ordinary soldier to salute when <i>you</i>
slink past officers&mdash;you, who ought to be a shining example?
Now I am going to report&mdash;"</p>
<p>Something in the Sergeant's eye, which seemed to be travelling
over my person generally, made me suddenly glance down at myself,
and it was then that, horror-struck, I realised that I was wearing
for the first time my new ten-guinea suit.</p>
<p>As I faded away the Sergeant clicked his heels and saluted
smartly.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<p><i>(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)</i></p>
<p><i>Within The Rim</i> (COLLINS) is, I suppose, the last of the
posthumous volumes of Mr. HENRY JAMES. It is a short book, produced
with the beauty that I have already grown to associate with the
imprint of its publishers, and containing five occasional pieces.
Of these the first, which gives its title to the whole, is the most
considerable: an essay of very moving poignancy, telling the
emotion of the writer during the earliest months of the War, in
"the most beautiful English summer conceivable," months that he
"was to spend so much of in looking over from the old rampart of a
little high-perched Sussex town at the bright blue streak of the
Channel ... and staring at the bright mystery beyond the rim of the
farthest opaline reach." In the thoughts to which HENRY JAMES here
gives expression one may find much of the love and sympathy for
this country that subsequently led to that assumption of British
citizenship which he intended as their demonstration to the world.
Of interest also in this same paper is the revelation of a mind
that knew already by a personal experience (of the American Civil
War) "what immensities our affair would carry in its bosom&mdash;a
knowledge that flattered me by its hint of immunity from illusion."
I would not be understood that this is a volume for the casual
reader, or even for one desirous of making a first acquaintance
with the Master, since much of it exemplifies not only the beauty
but the perplexities of his later style; but it is certainly one
which his disciples will not willingly be without.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Notebooks of a Spinster Lady</i> (CASSELL) is smallish talk
about biggish wigs of the Victorian era, but not on that sole
account to be condemned. Perhaps rather wholesome as showing how
little distant we are from an age of government of the people by
superior people for superior people. The notebooks cover the years
1878-1903, but the anecdotes have a much wider range, are often
indeed of a venerable antiquity. The lady of the notebooks was not,
I fancy, of a critical temper, and versions not too credible of
well-known <i>contes</i> figure in her quiet kindly pages. There
are moreover stories which I should not hesitate to describe as of
an appalling banality if they were not concerned with such very
nice people. On the whole I don't think it quite fair to the
spinster lady to have published her notes. They may well have been
painstaking jottings to provide material for polite conversation
and have sounded much better than they read in cold print. For
myself the real heroine of the book is <i>Maria</i>, the poet's
wife, who, on being waked and adjured by her spouse to get up and
strike a light for that he had just thought of a good word, replied
in un-Victorian mood, "Get up yourself! I have just thought of a
bad one."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Love&mdash;on Leave</i> (PEARSON) is the sufficiently
expressive title that Miss JESSIE POPE has chosen for a small book
of little courtship tales. You never saw a volume of its size, more
packed with love, which is shown leaping walls, laughing at
locksmiths and generally making the world go round in its
proverbial fashion. The pace of the revolutions may be found a
little disconcerting. You will perhaps be inclined to amend the
title and call the collection "Love on <i>Short</i> Leave," to mark
the regularity with which the respective heroes and heroines fall
into each others' arms at the end of every dozen pages or so. As a
matter of fact, the incident that is to my mind the best of the
bunch is an <span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id=
"page252"></a>[pg 252]</span> exception to this rule of
osculation&mdash;a happily imagined little comedy of a young wife
who thought to avoid the visit of a tiresome sister-in-law by
betaking herself for the night to the branches of a spreading
beech. Whether in actual life this is a probable course of conduct
need not exercise your mind; at least not enough to prevent your
enjoyment of her arboreal adventure, which comes, as I say, with
the more freshness as a break in what might else be a surfeit of
proposals. In effect, a gallant little florin's worth of
<i>fian&ccedil;ailles</i>; though, if you wish to avoid feeling
like a matrimonial agency, you will be well-advised to take it by
instalments rather than in bulk.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Among the pacific warriors in the great 1914-18 struggle there
is probably none who did better work, often under conditions of the
gravest peril, than Mr. G.M. TREVELYAN for the Red Cross in Italy.
Disqualified both by age and health from joining the army of
attack, he threw himself into the task&mdash;a labour of
love&mdash;of tending the sick and wounded of that country which he
knows so well and of whose greatest modern hero he is the classic
biographer. That the eulogist of GARIBALDI should hasten to the
succour of Italian soldiers was fitting, and how well he performed
the task the records of the Villa Trenta Hospital, near Udine, and
of the ambulance drivers under his command, abundantly tell. The
story of this beneficent campaign and of much besides is told with
too much modesty by Mr. TREVELYAN himself, in a book entitled
<i>Scenes from Italy's War</i> (JACK), which gives a series of the
vividest impressions of the Italian effort, and is remarkable for
the best analysis that I have yet seen of the causes that led to
the disaster of Caporetto. The pages in which Mr. TREVELYAN paints
the portrait of a typical Italian soldier, home sick and perplexed,
are likely to be borrowed by many more pretentious historians of
the War for years to come.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. JOHN HARGRAVE, the author and illustrator of <i>The Great
War Brings It Home</i> (CONSTABLE) has already a wide reputation in
the world of Scouts, gained not only by his enthusiasm but by his
profound knowledge of scout-craft. Here he tells us very plainly
that the War has brought home to us the fact that, if we are to
make good our losses in the ranks of the young and the fit, we have
got to give our children a better chance of living healthy,
wholesome lives. He urges the need of more outdoor education and as
many open-air camps as possible, and shows that, if we are to carry
out such a scheme as he lays in detail before us, scoutmasters and
still more scoutmasters are wanted. With reason he complains that
none of these good fellows is paid one halfpenny, and that nearly
all of them are young men who have to get a living. "Offer them,"
he says, "a living wage and how gladly would they become national
scoutmasters in charge of national camps." You may, if you are on
the look-out for it, find much that will seem fantastic in Mr.
HARGRAVE'S ideas; his appeal, however, is not to those of us who,
even in a case of great national urgency, cannot get away from the
tyranny of convention. Intrinsically his idea is sound, and I plead
with all my heart for a fair consideration of his schemes and for
help in their development.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. REX BEACH is one of the few prolific writers whose stories
increase in power as they increase in number, and this though they
are essentially novels of action rather than novels of thought. Of
his latest effort, <i>The Winds of Chance</i> (HODDER AND
STOUGHTON), one may say that there is not a tedious page in it. The
scene is laid in Yukon, a very vortex of life and colour and
excitement in fiction, whatever it may seem to the actual
inhabitants. The true hero of the story, <i>Napoleon Doret</i>, the
French voyageur, wins his heart's desire in the end and we breathe
a sigh of relief. The other hero is left the accepted swain of the
daughter of the Colonel of the North-West Mounted Police at Dawson,
and this we find a little hard to swallow, seeing what shady, not
to say immoral, company, male and female, he had just been basking
in. He is a weak creature and certainly should have married the
<i>Countess Courteau</i>, an Amazonian lady, who would have kept
him in order. But that is to be fastidious. The story is crisp and
vivid, and, anyway, those ancient prospectors, <i>Tom Linton</i>
and <i>Jerry McQuirk</i>, are worth twice the money.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. Punch has great pleasure in commending to his readers two
volumes of verse&mdash;<i>Rhymes of the Red Ensign</i> (HODDER AND
STOUGHTON), by Miss C. FOX SMITH, and <i>The Poets in Picardy</i>
(MURRAY), by Major E. DE STEIN&mdash;in which they will recognise
many poems that have appeared in his pages.</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
